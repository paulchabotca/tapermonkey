# Amazon Top Search Nav
This is a tapermonkey script that makes a copy of the search navigation at the bottom of the results and places it at the top.

## Installation
Copy + Pasta

## Comments
The dev branch of this contains my first implementation. For some reason I decided I should
create my own nav. Which involved many xpath calls and some math. Pretty much as soon as I
finished it, I realized I could just do one xpath and copy paste the html. Ha.
